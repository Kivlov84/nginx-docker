	<h2>A random Star Wars quote</h2>
	<p>Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.</p>
